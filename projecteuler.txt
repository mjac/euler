Problem 1


If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


15 is a multiple of both 3 and 5. Sum multiples of 3 and 5 then take away multiples of 15 as it has been counted twice.



Problem 5


2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


Prime number sieve, working out maximum exponent of each prime number. Multiply prime numbers raised to maximum exponent.



Problem 6


The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^(2) + 2^(2) + ... + 10^(2) = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^(2) = 55^(2) = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.


Use standard formulae to work out sums then calculate absolute difference.



Problem 3


The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?



??


Problem 4

Search through 100..999 x 100.999 space to find the largest palindrome.
Reduce computations by using memory.

javascript:var i = 1000, max = 0;while (--i >= 100){var j = 1000;while(--j >= i){ var n = String(i *j); if (n === n.split('').reverse().join('')) { document.write(n + " " + i + " " + j + "<br />"); max = Math.max(max, Number(n)); }}} alert(max);

88888 is first solution by the algorithm but not correct, it finds bigger lower down funnily enough.


Problem 7

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6^(th) prime is 13.

What is the 10001^(st) prime number?
